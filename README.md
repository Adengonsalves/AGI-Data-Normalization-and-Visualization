Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) Data Analysis Project

Developed a comprehensive data processing pipeline to analyze IRS Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) data by ZIP code and Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The project involved cleaning, aggregating, and enriching AGI data using Python and Pandas, with additional enrichment from metro-area data for enhanced geographical context. Key tasks included:

Normalized and aggregated income and filer data from raw IRS records.
Integrated metro data to add city, state, and MSA details by ZIP code.
Visualized top and bottom ZIP codes and MSAs based on average AGI using bar charts for clear comparison.
Outputted processed data to CSV for further analysis and reporting.
This project demonstrates expertise in data manipulation, normalization, and insightful visualizations of socio-economic trends across various regions in the U.S.
